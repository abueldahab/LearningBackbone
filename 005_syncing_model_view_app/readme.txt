   Learning Backbon - 005 - Syncing Model and Views
------------------------------------------------------

This example purpose is to test how Backbone can help to build app by syncing
model's data changes to views objects.

I will try to set up a form asking for personal data then update two views by binding 
model's change event to view's render() method.
